**Subject: Application for Software Engineer, AI Agents Engineering Team**

Dear Affirm Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Software Engineer role on the AI Agents engineering team at Affirm, as advertised on [Platform where you saw it, e.g., LinkedIn]. Your mission to create honest and transparent financial products deeply resonates with my commitment to leveraging technology for positive user impact, and I am particularly excited by the opportunity to contribute to a newly formed team focused on innovative conversational AI solutions.

My technical foundation includes hands-on experience in Java development from my role as a Java Programmer/Coder at One Exchange Corporation, where I was responsible for troubleshooting and improving a commodity trading platform. Critically, my self-taught proficiency in **Python** (alongside Java, C#, PyGame, and Pandas) directly aligns with your requirements for API development. Furthermore, my experience as Lead Coder for the Rundle Robotics Team involved designing and implementing complex, multi-library Java code for an advanced competitive robot, demonstrating my ability to tackle intricate problems and deliver well-tested solutions under pressure. My active participation in the AI Club also speaks to my foundational interest in the domain.

I am particularly drawn to the AI Agents team's focus on taking ownership and navigating "big unknowns." My experiences, from leading a competitive robotics team to independently mastering multiple programming languages, reflect a proactive, growth-oriented mindset. I thrive in collaborative environments, as evidenced by my work at One Exchange where clear communication and team planning were essential for project success. I am eager to bring both my technical expertise and a strong desire to learn and execute to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my blend of technical skills, collaborative spirit, and passion for innovation would make me a valuable addition to Affirm. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,
Henry J. van Weelderen
